# Wheeleg Host Tools

Two host-side tools share the same `PC → WiFi TCP:23 → Robot ESP32` path:

1. `wheeleg_vision_bridge` — ROS 2 package, camera + MediaPipe → commands
2. `tools/keyboard_drive.py` — standalone WASD teleop over TCP

Both talk the same line protocol (`DRIVE`, `YAWRATE`, `BLE_DISABLE`, `JUMP`, ...).

---

## Addressing

The robot ESP32 advertises mDNS as `wheeleg.local` (port 23) once it joins WiFi.
All tools default to that hostname; fall back to the DHCP IP printed on the USB
serial monitor if mDNS is unavailable on your network.

---

## `tools/keyboard_drive.py` — WASD over WiFi

```bash
python3 /home/yahboom/Desktop/esp32-wheeleg-A-main/host/tools/keyboard_drive.py
# or, with an explicit host
python3 keyboard_drive.py --host 192.168.1.23 --rate 20
```

Keys:

| key | effect |
|-----|--------|
| `W` / `S` | toggle forward / backward |
| `A` / `D` | toggle left / right yaw |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | speed preset 150 / 250 / 350 mm/s |
| `space` | hard stop (`DRIVE,0,0` + `QUEUE_STOP`) |
| `H` | reprint help |
| `Q` | quit cleanly (re-enables Xbox BLE) |

On start the script sends `BLE_DISABLE` then `DRIVE,0,0`; on any exit path
(`atexit`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`, `Ctrl+C`) it sends `DRIVE,0,0` → `YAWRATE,0` →
`BLE_ENABLE`.

> `DRIVE` only moves the robot after balance is enabled. Trigger standup via the
> Xbox `A` button (or send `BALANCE_ON` on the USB serial console) **before**
> driving.

---

## Command protocol (shared)

Direct-teleop commands bypass the queue and need periodic re-sending:

```
DRIVE,<speed_mm_s>,<yaw_mrad_s>     direct teleop, 500 ms watchdog on robot
YAWRATE,<mrad_s>                    yaw-only direct, 500 ms watchdog
```

Queue commands run to completion:

```
FORWARD,<pct>,<sec>
BACKWARD,<pct>,<sec>
LEFT,<deg>,<sec>
RIGHT,<deg>,<sec>
JUMP
INCREASELEGLENGTH,<units>
DECREASELEGLENGTH,<units>
CROSSLEG,0,<sec>
QUEUE_STATUS / QUEUE_STOP / QUEUE_PAUSE / QUEUE_RESUME
```

Arbitration / safety:

```
BLE_DISABLE / BLE_ENABLE            enable/disable Xbox controller input
VISION_DISABLE / VISION_ENABLE      enable/disable all WiFi-side input
BALANCE_ON / BALANCE_OFF            caution: BALANCE_ON auto-triggers standup
```

Robot-side watchdogs:

- `DRIVE` target is zeroed if no new `DRIVE` for 500 ms
- `YAWRATE` target is zeroed if no new `YAWRATE` for 500 ms
- TCP client is force-closed if no line arrives for 1500 ms; on disconnect the
  robot injects `DRIVE,0,0 + YAWRATE,0 + QUEUE_STOP`

## `wheeleg_vision_bridge` — ROS 2 vision node

### Build

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd /home/yahboom/Desktop/esp32-wheeleg-A-main/host/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select wheeleg_vision_bridge
source install/setup.bash
```

### Camera

Start the micro-ROS agent in a dedicated terminal:

```bash
/home/yahboom/Desktop/esp32-wheeleg-A-main/host/scripts/camera_quickstart.sh
```

Default image topic: `/espRos/esp32camera` (`sensor_msgs/CompressedImage`).

### Run

```bash
ros2 launch wheeleg_vision_bridge bridge.launch.py
```

The bridge starts in `idle` mode with `dry_run: true` — no commands are
transmitted. `transport: tcp` and `tcp_host: wheeleg.local` are the current
defaults (see `config/config.yaml`).

Launch-time overrides are available for common experiment settings:

```bash
ros2 launch wheeleg_vision_bridge bridge.launch.py mode:=gesture debug_window:=true debug_events:=true
```

`debug_window:=true` opens a live monitor with camera framing guides, FPS, current
label, stable label, and generated command. Use it while adjusting the camera or
collecting E10 reliability data. Leave it off for latency or real-time timing
measurements because it adds GUI and optional vision-processing load.

For presentation/demo use, prefer the larger audience-facing overlay:

```bash
ros2 launch wheeleg_vision_bridge bridge.launch.py mode:=gesture dry_run:=true presentation_window:=true presentation_fullscreen:=true presentation_mirror:=true
```

This shows a cleaner monitor with the project title, recognised gesture, and
generated robot command in large text. Set `dry_run:=false` only when the robot is
physically safe to command.

For a monitor that can run beside any camera experiment:

```bash
python3 /home/yahboom/Desktop/B-BOT/host/tools/camera_preview.py --labels --scale 2.0
```

Presentation-only standalone monitor:

```bash
python3 /home/yahboom/Desktop/B-BOT/host/tools/camera_preview.py --presentation --fullscreen --mirror
```

### Mode switching

```bash
ros2 param set /wheeleg_vision_bridge mode gesture
ros2 param set /wheeleg_vision_bridge mode stunt
ros2 param set /wheeleg_vision_bridge mode face
ros2 param set /wheeleg_vision_bridge mode idle
```

### Gesture mapping (DRIVE-based, continuous)

| gesture | command |
|---------|---------|
| fist (Zero) | `DRIVE,0,0` |
| open palm (Five) | `DRIVE,250,0` |
| point left | `DRIVE,0,600` |
| point right | `DRIVE,0,-600` |
| thumb up | `JUMP` (impulse, blocked unless `stunt_armed=true`) |

Gesture DRIVE commands are re-sent at `command_rate_hz` (default 10 Hz) so the
robot-side 500 ms watchdog is fed; losing the hand drops the target to
`DRIVE,0,0` immediately.

### Stunt safety gate

Stunt mode's `JUMP` and `CROSSLEG,0,5` are **blocked by default** to avoid
someone in the camera frame accidentally triggering acrobatics:

```bash
ros2 param set /wheeleg_vision_bridge stunt_armed true    # arm
ros2 param set /wheeleg_vision_bridge stunt_armed false   # disarm
```

### Going live

Disable dry-run only after bench validation:

```bash
ros2 param set /wheeleg_vision_bridge dry_run false
```

---

## Safety reminders

- Keep physical power accessible during bench tests
- Use `dry_run: true` until every mode has been individually verified
- `BALANCE_ON` triggers a standup action — never send it to an unsecured robot
- The robot's watchdog stops motion on disconnect, but a held physical stop is
  still the most reliable last line of defense
